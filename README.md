## Project Abstract
What the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level. (You can include screenshot mockup of the interface)

This document proposes a web application of a todo app called “Doing”. This application will be a task manager. The user will be able to add tasks, task descriptions, and recurring tasks (habits). The app will also keep track of data, and calculate the average number of tasks completed per day, per week, and predict the user’s most productive days. Additionally this app will have a journal feature, where the user can jot down notes on their day. This app will be a task manager, habit tracker, and journal all in one.

## Conceptual Design
This will be a web application will be written in python and use the framework Django to host the web application server. I will be using javascript, css, and html to design the website.

## Proof of Concept
https://github.com/amyollomani1/ToDo
Here is the repository. I used the Django framework, and I have set up the sign in page, log in, and password reset page. Additionally, once the user signs in, there is a pop up asking the user to enter a todo. The website is designed with html and css and javascript. Run the server by typing python3 manage.py runserver. Then you will need to make an account to access the home page.

## Background
The most similar product to this is the Things app. The Things app is a task manager with a clean, simple interface. However it is $50 a year. My app will be free, but it will work similarly to this app. Additionally the app todoist has a similar data tracking feature that I will draw inspiration from. My app will combine the simplicity of things with the data tracking of todoist, while being free, since both other apps are expensive. These sources of inspiration are private, however there is a public repository called To-Do-App that contains a simple to do interface I may draw inspiration from. This app is a little too simple, since I plan on having a journal and recurring tasks feature.

## Required Resources

I will need to learn about web application development. I may need to learn about MySQL for user data and javascript to create a pretty website.  Due to the steep learning curve the overall user interface may be ugly and rushed. I will also need to learn how to tie in javascript with a Python and Django backend.
